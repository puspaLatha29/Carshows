<h1 className="display-8 text-center">Original Porsche Crest</h1>
<p>An essential and much-loved detail of our classic cars is available once again. Following extensive research, the experts at Porsche Classic have reproduced the Original Porsche Crest. The relaunched crest is true to the colours and materials of the original and is, of course, "Made in Germany“.With such an unmistakable and coveted symbol, there are naturally many curious stories, ranging from the true one to simply made-up versions. The experts from Porsche Classic have dug deep into the history of the Crest, which was initiated in 1952 at a meeting between Ferry Porsche and the then US importer Max Hoffman as a seal of quality for the Type 356. In the same year, the then head of advertising, Herrmann Lapper, and the designer, Franz Xaver Reimspieß, presented a draft that to this day has only been changed ever so slightly. Reimspieß sketched a fantasy crest that symbolised the roots of the company as well as the dynamism and quality of its products. At the centre of the golden shield, the horse from the official Stuttgart coat of arms (the Stuttgarter Rössle) is depicted along with the name of the city. Around this shield are the Red and Black of the state and stylised antlers from the coat of arms of Württemberg-Hohenzollern. The Porsche logo arches above it.</p>

<p>In contrast to the current crest, the Porsche logo on the original crest was only embossed and was not black. In addition, the red elements of the crest were actually rather orange in colour to reflect the Württemberg-Hohenzollern state colours.  

The classic Porsche Crest had to meet the usual high quality standards. For example, an alternating climate test was carried out in the Porsche Research and Development Centre in Weissach. Of course, it passed the test with flying colours.

A truly high-quality product – 100% "Made in Germany". The classic Porsche cars are well prepared for a long life, bearing their historic coat of arms as a symbol of this quality..</p>
